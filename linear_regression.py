## Docs
# Algorithm called linear regression and linear regression is used to predict values based on previous
# values that we've decided to insert. So a very simple use case of linear regression would be to calculate
# the wage of a certain person as time goes on. As you can see, we have lots of values that kind of don't go into a
# straight line, but they do fit a linear regression model. So essentially what this is telling us is the correlation
# between all of these values and how it's going to look like in the future, and it's pretty accurate
# and it's a very good algorithm to learn.
